What is React Js ?

React js is declarative ,efficiet and flexible javascript library for building reusable Ui components

It s an open-source ,Component based front end library developed and maintained by FaceBook And later used in its products like Whats App ad Instagram.

Why we use React Js?

To develop User Interface(UI) ,It improves performance of he application, it uses Virtual Dom(JavaScript Object)


React Js was created by Jordan Walke.

Most of the WebSites are built Using MVC(Model View Controller)

React is the 'v' which stands for view(Presentation layer)


React Js application is made up of Multiple Components ,each component responsible for small, reusable piece of html code . 

Components can be nested with other components to allow Complex applications to be built of simple building blocks.

React Limtations ?
---------------------

Covers only the view layer of the application.Hence we still need to choose other tehcnlogies
to get complete tooling set for Development

How many ways to create React Js Application ?

There are many ways to create React Js application but we can focus 3 Different approaches
CDN Links
npm(Node Package Manager)
npx(Node Package eXmplorer)


Develop First React Js Application
=====================================

Step 1 : Set up your Development Environmnet

Node.js  and Npm(Node PackageManager) installed on your system.
Step 2: Create A New React Js Project

npx create-react-app <applicationname>

eg : npx create-react-app firstapp

Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

After the project is created ,navigate to the project directory using the following command

cd firstapp


step 4 : Staart the development Server

Once your are inside the project Directory Start development server by running the command

npm start


This command will start th development server and open your application in a web browser at
http: localhost:3000

Step 5:
Explore the Project Structure

The project structre iscreated by create-react-app and contains various files and folders
The main code for your React Application will be in the src folder

open the Project in your prefered coe editor and explore the files

Step 6: Make changes and see live updates

As you make changes to your code files(e.g., in src/App.js)
The development server will automatically update the application in the browser.
you can experiment with modify the defult code in src/App.js to see the live updates
